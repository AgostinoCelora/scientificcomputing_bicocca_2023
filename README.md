# Scientific Computing with Python

[Davide Gerosa](https://davidegerosa.com/)  - davide.gerosa@unimib.it  
University of Milano-Bicocca, 2023.

## Aims

The python programming language and its library ecosystem are now an essential tool in modern science. This class will provide an advanced introduction to phython and its main functionalities, focusing in particular on its applications to computational physics. Targeted topics include: array vectorization with numpy, pretty plotting with matplotlib, scientific recipes with scipy, module packaging, and code testing. The format will be highly intractive and taylored to the research interest of the students. I will also introduce other essential computational tools such as the git version-control protocol.  

## Lectures


1. [**Introduction: python**](lectures/L01_python.ipynb). Why. Basics. Datatypes. Control flow (if/for/while). Functions. Classes. Modules. Exceptions. File I/O. *Exercises.*
2. [**Arrays: numpy**](lectures/L02_numpy.ipynb). Array. Shaping. Slicing. Masking. Avoid loops. *Exercises.*
3. [**Plotting: matplotlib**](lectures/L03_matplotlib.ipynb). Pretty plotting. OO interface. Latex compatibility. Lines. Histograms. Contour maps. Annotations. Surfaces. *Exercises.*  
4. [**Numerical methods: scipy**](lectures/L04_scipy.ipynb). Integration. Interpolation. Root finding. Initial value problems. Boundary value problems. Fitting. Fourier transforms. Linear algebra. *Exercises.* 
5. [**Symbolic maths: sympy**](lectures/L05_sympy.ipynb). Symbols. Substitution. Simplification. Calculus. Solvers. Units. *Exercises.*

### Texbooks

There are infinitely many textbooks on scientific computing. Three that I think are particularly interesting:

- ["Learning Scientific Programming with Python"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/learning-scientific-programming-with-python/3D264483BC7B380A3059B3861C661237), C. Hill, Cambridge University Press, 2020. Supporting [code](https://scipython.com/). *This textbook provides a gentle introduction; it's the perfect starting point.* 
- ["Scientific Computing with Python: High-performance scientific computing with NumPy, SciPy, and pandas"](https://www.packtpub.com/product/scientific-computing-with-python-second-edition/9781838822323), C. Fuhrer, O. Verdier, J. E., Packt Publishing, 2021. Supporting [code](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Second-Edition). *This book is more advanced. It's ideal for sharpening your existing Python skills and go the extra mile. Instead of keep on coding the same way, as some point you'll want to it better. It's one of my go-to reference when looking for a specific topic/task.*
- ["Effective Computation in Physics"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-computation-in/9781491901564/), A. Scopatz, K. D. Huff, O'Reilly Media, 2015. *I really like this textbook because it has a bit of everything you might need for science, not just python. Things like command line operations, data visualization, regular expressions, version control, debugging, latex, etc).*

This a Python ester egg... you can truly `pip install antigravity` and `import antigravity`. Try!
