pip3 install -U pytest --user

note: it might install it in ~/.local/bin/ but you might have a
different version of pytest elsewhere in your path.

the older version was `py.test` now, it is `pytest`

to make sure that you get the version consistent with your install, you can do:

python3 -m pytest
