        "is highly suggested that you work through that on your own.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a few ways in which we can use git.  We'll start by assuming\n",
        "that we are the only developer on a project and learn the basics and\n",
        "then we'll see how to share what we've done locally and remotely using\n",
        "GitHub.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Let's start by setting up our git environment:\n",

        "git config --global user.name \"name\"\n",
        "git config --global user.email \"email\"\n",

        "\n",
        "Replace `name` with your name and `email` with your email.  This sets `nano`\n",
        "as our default editor, but you can choose something else that you are comfortable\n",

        "project.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. First create a project directory with some basic content:\n",
