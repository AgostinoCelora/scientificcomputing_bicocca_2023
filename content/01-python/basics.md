# Python Basics

The following references give helpful introductions to python:

* The [official python tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

* The [software carpentry python lessons](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)


## Practicing

Some resources for practicing on your own:

* [Code Academy python rack](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python): 
  step-by-step tutorial through the basics of the language

* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/):
  a set of increasingly complex programming tasks to try out with
  python

## Datatypes

Python is a dynamically typed language -- this means that you don't
need to specify ahead of time what kind of data you are going to store
in a variable.  Nevertheless, there are some core datatypes that we
need to become familiar with as we use the language.

The first set of datatypes are similar to those found in other
languages (like C/C++ and Fortran): floating point numbers, integers,
and strings.

Floating point is essential for computational science.  A great
introduction to floating point and its limitations is: [What every
computer scientist should know about floating-point
arithmetic](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=103163) by
D. Goldberg.

The next set of datatypes are containers.  In python, unlike some
languages, these are built into the language and make it very easy to
do complex operations.
