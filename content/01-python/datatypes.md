# Datatypes

Python is a dynamically typed language -- this means that you don't
need to specify ahead of time what kind of data you are going to store
in a variable.  Nevertheless, there are some core datatypes that we
need to become familiar with as we use the language.

The first set of datatypes are similar to those found in other
languages (like C/C++ and Fortran): floating point numbers, integers,
and strings.

The next set of datatypes are containers.  In python, unlike some
languages, these are built into the language and make it very easy to
do complex operations.
