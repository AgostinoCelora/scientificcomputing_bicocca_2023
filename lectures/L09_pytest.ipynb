    "## Types of testing\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of different types of software testing that exist.\n",
    "Most commonly, for scientific codes, we hear about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unit testing : Tests that a single function does what it was designed to do\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integration testing : Tests whether the individual pieces work together as intended.\n",
    "  Sometimes done one piece at a time (iteratively)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regression testing : Checks whether changes have changed answers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Verification & Validation (from the science perspective)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Verification: are we solving the equations correctly?\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Validation: are we solving the correct equations?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automating testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The best testing is automated.  Github provides a *continuous integration* service that can\n",
    "be run on pull requests.  You write a short definition (a Github workflow) that tells Github\n",
    "how to run your tests and then any time there is a change, the tests are run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unit testing\n",
    "\n",
    "* When to write tests?\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Some people advocate writing a unit test for a specification\n",
    "    before you write the functions they will test\n",
    "\n",
    "    * This is called Test-driven development (TDD):\n",
    "      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This helps you understand the interface, return values,\n",
    "    side-effects, etc. of what you intend to write\n",
    "\n",
    "* Often we already have code, so we can start by writing tests to\n",
    "  cover some core functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Add new tests when you encounter a bug, precisely to ensure that\n",
    "    this bug doesn't arise again\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tests should be short\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You want to be able to run them frequently\n",
